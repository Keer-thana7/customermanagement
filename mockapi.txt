Summary of "Aunt Jennifer's Tigers" by Adrienne Rich
"Aunt Jennifer's Tigers" by Adrienne Rich is a poignant poem that delves into themes of oppression, gender roles, and the desire for freedom. The poem is structured in three quatrains, each highlighting different aspects of Aunt Jennifer's life and her needlework.

The poem opens with Aunt Jennifer embroidering tigers that prance across a screen. These tigers are depicted as bright, bold, and fearless, symbolizing strength and independence. This imagery stands in stark contrast to Aunt Jennifer's own life, suggesting a longing for the freedom and power that the tigers represent.

In the second stanza, the focus shifts to Aunt Jennifer's hands, which are "fluttering" through the wool, indicating her nervousness and frailty. The "massive weight of Uncle's wedding band" on her fingers symbolizes the oppressive nature of her marriage, highlighting the constraints imposed on her by a patriarchal society. This metaphor underscores the burdens she bears and her lack of autonomy.

The final stanza reflects on Aunt Jennifer's mortality. The speaker imagines that even in death, Aunt Jennifer will be burdened by the constraints of her marriage, her hands still encircled by the wedding band. However, the tigers she created will continue to "prance, proud and unafraid," symbolizing a form of lasting defiance and the enduring spirit of freedom she expressed through her art.

Through this vivid contrast between Aunt Jennifer's constrained existence and the liberated spirit of her tigers, Rich critiques the societal limitations placed on women and celebrates the resilience and creativity that enable them to transcend their circumstances.
